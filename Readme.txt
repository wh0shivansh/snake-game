Hello Readers I'm Shivansh Upadhyay, not much introduction about me lets move to the important part directly.

if(You are a beginner)
{
    " Then read this "

Actually I'm not the first one who implemented this code but, maybe I'm the first one who explained this code in the easiest and
most effecient way.

There maybe some bugs in the code, or some more efficient method so you can edit and make a version of your own.

Don't Just copy and run the code it will not help in understanding it.

Either view the source code and type the whole code again with some new variable ,new co-ordinates, etc
Or editing the code will help.
